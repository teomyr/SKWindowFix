SKWindowFix attempts to bring the classic Skyrim game to the age of multi-
tasking operating systems, enabling it to work properly with modern operating
system features such as the ALT+TAB window switching introduced in Windows 1.0.

Currently, it incorporates workarounds for the following issues that appear on
some systems:

- Black, unresponsive game window when switching back to Skyrim using ALT+TAB
  or the task bar
- Extra Windows cursor appearing after switching back to Skyrim using ALT+TAB
  or the task bar

Results may differ between systems. The extra cursor issue is not completely
gone, but should occur much less often.

The plugin requires Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) to be installed, which can be
downloaded at <http://skse.silverlock.org/>.

To install, copy the file "skwindowfix.dll" into the directory
"Data\SKSE\Plugins" of your Skyrim application directory, creating the
respective directories if necessary.
